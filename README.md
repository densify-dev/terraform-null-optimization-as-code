# Densify
This module is the interface between Densify machine learning analytics and Terraform templates. 
It enables two operations:
- auto-tagging of cloud instances and containers based on Densify’s optimization analysis (making them “self-aware”)
-	automated optimization of instance families/sizes, and container resource requests/limits (making them “self-optimizing”) 

This integration is based on densify.auto.tfvars, which is automatically generated by Densify and contains operational intelligence, analysis findings, and optimization recommendations for each cloud instance or container in scope. This module unpacks data from this structure, making it available to Terraform as variables, enabling precise specification of resources to optimally match the learned patterns of behavior. 
The result is next-generation resource optimization with the elimination of hard-coded resource specifications.

## Requirements
- Densify account, which is provided with a Densify subscription or free trial (www.densify.com/trial)


## Usage

```hcl
module "optimization-as-code" {

  densify_recommendations = "${var.densify_recommendations}"
  densify_fallback = "${var.densify_fallback}"
  densify_unique_id = "${var.name}"
}
```
