# Densify
Module to provide an interface between Densify machine learning analytics and Terraform templates, enabling auto-tagging of cloud instances and containers based on Densify's optimization analysis (making them “self-aware”), and automated optimization of instance families, sizes, and resource requests/limits (making them “self-optimizing”).  

This interface is based on densify.auto.tfvars, which is automatically generated by Densify, and contains operational intelligence, analysis findings, and optimization recommendations for each cloud instance or container in scope. This module unpacks the data in this structure and makes it available in Terraform as variables, enabling precise specification of resources to optimally match the learned patterns of behaviour. This provides next-generation resource optimization and eliminates hard-coded resource specifications.

  densify_recommendations = "${var.densify_recommendations}"
  default_fallback = "${var.default_fallback}"
  densify_unique_id = "${var.name}"
}
